    <p>Dear reader,<br>
    It’s okay to be tired. It’s okay to pause, to breathe, to let your mind rest for a moment. Every small step you take tomorrow will matter. You are doing your best, and that is enough.</p>

    <p>Dear student at 2am,<br>
    I know the world feels heavy and quiet, but remember — every page you write and every thought you hold is a victory. You are not alone in your silence.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="letter">
    <p>Dear dreamer,<br>
    Nights can feel endless, but the sunrise is waiting. Keep drawing, keep writing, keep breathing. One step is enough.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="letter">
    <p>Dear overthinker,<br>
    Your thoughts may swirl like storm clouds, but even storms pass. Each word you write calms a little piece of your mind. Let yourself feel — it’s part of the journey.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="letter">
    <p>Dear quiet soul,<br>
    Even if no one notices, your late-night sketches, your secret writings, your silent dreams — they matter. You are creating a world only you can see, and that world is beautiful.</p>
